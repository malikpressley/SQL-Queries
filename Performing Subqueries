Using a subquery to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.
Giving my subquery an alias, “total_amount_paid”.

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_amount_paid
FROM (SELECT SUM(A.amount) as total_amount, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo') GROUP BY B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid


A query to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.

SELECT E.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT B.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM country E
INNER JOIN city D ON E.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN address C on D.city_id = C.city_Id
INNER JOIN customer B on C.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers ON E.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY E.country, top_5_customers
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
